## (2) Results                                                                           
To perform better analysis, I have extracted the data from both deliverable reports into one excel file and added some additional columns to show the data with more views.

### <ins> Retiring Titles <ins>
  
Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are the biggest groups with employees who are of their retirement age. They both take up more than 30% of the retirement population, whereas other job title groups are taking up less than 15% of the population. 
 
Manager has the least number of employees with the retirement age and with very minimal effect on the outcome too, as there are only two employees who are manager out of 72,458 employees. 
 
### <ins> Mentorship Eligibility <ins>
  
Unlike the Retiring Titles output, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are not the biggest groups. The distribution is split fairly even among, Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, and Staff with an average of each group taking up 22% of the total mentorship eligible group population. 
 
Moreover, none of the manager title employees is eligible for the mentorship program. 
 
### <ins> Mentorship Eligibility / Retiring Titles<ins>

Although Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are the biggest groups with employees reaching their retirement age. The total percentage of mentorship eligibility is not the highest but equivalent to low, less than 2% of the employees of their employee group is eligible for the mentorship program. 
 
On the opposite, employees in Engineer, Staff, and Assistant Engineer have more employees being eligible to participate to the mentorship program. 

## (3) Summary                                                                           
  
Technically, Pewlett Hackard is at risk that 72,458 individuals are reaching to their retirement age, and only 1,940 of them are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, which is 2.68% of the retirement group. 
 
From a headcount standpoint, the company would need to backfill all 72,458 roles. 
 
However, there are more factors that would be helpful. 
 
First, out of the Retiring Titles group, we can use queries to categorize the population into groups to visually how many people are retiring soon and later. 
 
Subsequently, we should pull data on existing employees with titles below these retiring titles, in order to come up with promotion plans to move the people upward in order to resolve the backfilling issues. This would require creating a new set of tables and using queries to show the reporting line connection.
